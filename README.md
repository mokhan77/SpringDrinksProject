# SpringDrinksProject

https://muhammadkhan.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/DP/boards/2

I am doing this project to create a backend of a website. This backend uses API calls that allow it to add new drinks to a list, read drinks from a list, and also update and delete drinks from the list. 

I expected the project to be challenging as there were a lot of different aspects to be worked on at the same time, such as Jira, GitHub, and the coding itself. This meant that I had to concentrate on my time, as it was very easy to focus on small details of one part of the project and then struggle for time with other parts.  

One thing I did well is that I manage to work well independently. Before the project started, I thought that I would struggle a lot on my own, and would be asking for help all of the time. However, I managed to fix the problems I was having on my own. 

One thing that did not go well was the testing aspect. The testing took up most of my time and it was frustrating when a test that looked like it should be working was not working. However, I knew that the testing would be the section that I would struggle on the most beforehand, so I gave myself plenty of time to achieve as much coverage as I could. 

If I were to do this project again, I think that I would manage time better. Although I had enough time on all parts of the project, I think that it would be useful to create a timetable of what I am going to do and when I am going to do it. This means that as soon as I finish a section of the project, I can quickly bounce into a new part without wasting too much time thinking about what I would like to do next.
